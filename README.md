# Empruntout

## Idea:
The general idea for this project was to make a platform that enables users to put items or equipment they possess and don't use that often for renting.<br>
In doing so clients can have a small income streams from things they already possesed and were going to stay laying around anyway.<br>
Items can range from camping equipment to garden machines to practically anything that anyone has a use for.<br>

## Software architecture:
We made this project with scaling in mind, and so we chose the microservices architecture to enable us to do so.<br>
Tech stack: React, Nest.js (TypeORM), and PostgreSQL.<br>
A frontend that communicates with a REST API is the basic structure of the website when in production.
